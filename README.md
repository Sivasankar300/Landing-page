### This is a Project part of The Odin Project's Curriculum.

It is a landing project where we replicate a website based on an image of it along with formats for font, and font-size. Lesson Link: https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-landing-page.
It focuses on deepening my knowledge of Flexbox and CSS selectors.
